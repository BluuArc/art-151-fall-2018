# Web Narrative Project

## Prompt

Using p5, create an interactive narrative web app that uses interactive HTML elements such as sliders, buttons, clicks, text boxes, etc. and CSS styling. This narrative can be whatever you want, from something mundane like grocery shopping, to something abstract like plants having a conversations or creating a looping narrative playing with ideas of time and space.

For the project:

* Create at least 3 different “scenes” that are triggered by different interactions.
  * Intro Screen
  * Room Screen (+ variants)
    * Different info based on conditions in and around room
    * Different options based on what's in the room and the player's inventory
  * Game Over/Game Finish Screen - differs based on actions leading to it.
* Use at least 3 different HTML input elements to progress the narrative.
  * Buttons for traversing rooms
  * Radio buttons for choosing attack angle
  * Name Input for naming
* Every new scene should have an interactive element on the page

# Miscellaneous Info

This game is based on an [old school project](https://sites.google.com/site/uic141spring2016/prog-6-wumpus) related to "Hunt the Wumpus". 

* Features a 20 room maze with randomized locations of various entities.
* Game entities include chests, traps, pits, exit(s), and the Wumpus, all with randomized locations
* Stamina system ensures that game doesn't last too long, while providing players with a challenge to escape the maze as soon as possible.
* Chests can give the player a sword or a food item. Whether they are used and who they are used for is up to the player.
