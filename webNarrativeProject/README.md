# Web Narrative Project

## Prompt

Using p5, create an interactive narrative web app that uses interactive HTML elements such as sliders, buttons, clicks, text boxes, etc. and CSS styling. This narrative can be whatever you want, from something mundane like grocery shopping, to something abstract like plants having a conversations or creating a looping narrative playing with ideas of time and space.

For the project:

* Create at least 3 different “scenes” that are triggered by different interactions.
  * Intro Screen
  * Room Screen (+ variants)
    * Different info based on conditions in and around room
    * Different options based on what's in the room and the player's inventory
  * Game Over/Game Finish Screen - differs based on actions leading to it.
* Use at least 3 different HTML input elements to progress the narrative.
  * Buttons for traversing rooms
  * Radio buttons for choosing attack angle
  * Name Input for naming
* Every new scene should have an interactive element on the page
