# OpenWeatherMaps Visualization Project

## Prompt
Make a weather application using your Open Weather API key. Combine this with another JSON file and find interesting relationships, or lack thereof, between weather and the data of your choice. For instance, instead of wind speed related to the speed of an object, maybe itâ€™s related to the dimensions of an image from a Google image search of wind. Or maybe create a poetic composition with the weather conditions and a list of fruit.

Requirements:

* use at least two DOM objects (text boxes, drop down menus, buttons)
* use at least two JSON files (weather and JSON of your choice)
  * 5 day weather forcast from OWM
  * 2017 sunset/sunrise data set from [here](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php)
  * bike incident data from [here](https://www.bikewise.org/documentation/api_v2#!/locations)
* use callbacks
