# Processing Multimedia Project

Using some of the technique we went over in class, create an interactive video application. This could be simply choosing videos from a drop down menu, creating a series of masks using facial recognition, creating an “installation” type application using motion, a game using color tracking, etc.

This is a variant of [Project 4 of my IT202 project from Fall 2017](https://joshuacastor.me/IT202/project4/). Instead of being controlled by the keyboard, however, the controls are determined based on the positioning of one's shoulders.
